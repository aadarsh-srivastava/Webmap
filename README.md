# Webmap
This will have the webmap script with necessary files for the python for everybody coursera course. 
Add the location you want to add to map by writing it in the where.txt file, preferably at either top or bottom. Now run the geoload script first to find co-ordinates of your desired location. Then run the geodump file to add this location to the database. Everytime to add a new location to database, increase the count condition to one more. Finally run the where.html file to create and display the map.
